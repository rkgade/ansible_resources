# Playbooks

Used to write better ansible scripts that has good features which ansible can understand and easy for developers to understand.

To install a S/W

$ ansible local -s -m shell -a 'yum install lynx -y'

Now, using playbooks, we can write something like :

$ ansible local -s -m yum -a 'pkg=lynx state=installed update_cache=true'


To put the above command into a playbook, please refer lynx_install.yml
